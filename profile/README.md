# Overview

Welcome to the home for the Policy Horizons Lab at the University of Toronto Scarborough.

Our lab is supported by the Political Accountability, Transparency, and Representation Oversight Network (PATRON/ROTIP). PATRON is a multi-year partnership funded by SSHRC and the University of Toronto. PATRON strengthens Canadian democracy by building a searchable public-interest data repository of linked databases covering political representation, transparency, and accountability.

The project supports an interdisciplinary research program to expose distortions in Canadian governance through civic non-profits, and training students via an experiential learning pipeline.

Within PATRON, the Social Science Working Group (SSWG) drives the research agenda, organized around three thematic streams:

1. **Governance, Accountability & Representation:**
Analyzing how political institutions, electoral systems, and lobbying practices shape who is (or isn't) represented in Canadian politics and how voices of certain groups may be marginalized.

2. **Political Finance & Transparency:**
Investigating the flows of money in politics (e.g., donations, third-party advertising, corporate influence), government procurement, and evaluating how financial transparency or reforms affect political behaviour and party strategies.

3. **Electoral Integrity & Political Behaviour:**
Examining factors that influence democratic participation (such as voting systems, incidences of misinformation, voter engagement or polarization), and the role of information in sustaining democratic participation.
